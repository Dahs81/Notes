Chapter 9: Style
	- indent 4 spaces
	- use spaces consistantly
	- if (true) { ... } -- space between 'if (' AND ') {'
	- no spaces for function invocation -- myFunction()
	- make comments meaningful, don't add meaningless comments -- example: i = 0; //Set i to zero
	- declare all variables at the beginning of a function - due to js lack of block scope
